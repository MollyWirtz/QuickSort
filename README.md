# QuickSort
Sort an array using QuickSort algorithm 


At the beginning, the program creates an array of 100 values randomly selected from the range of [1..1000]. 
This is the array that will be sorted. 

As the program executes, each iteration is printed as the current state of the sorting, with the last line being completely sorted.
